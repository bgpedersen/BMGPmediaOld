# BMGPmedia (currently in development)
Portfolio website for Bjarne MÃ¸lgaard Gerhardt-Pedersen. 

This project is created from scratch, meaning I dont use any premade templates or CMS platforms to assist me. But I do use technologies to assist me, such as small JavaScript plugins etc.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my coding skills. But of course, since its a Portfolio website, it 
contains information about me, my projects and contact details.

I use the following technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS and a some different JS plugins
